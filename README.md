# miscPCBs

Assorted PCB designs that aren't associated with any code etc.

Any PCBs I design that are part of projects with code will be in the
same repositories as the code.

I haven't chosen the licence for these yet but it will be an open one,
probably the CERN Open Hardware Licence.

QuadLampDriver
--------------

4 x VN7007AHTR power switch chips (effectively fancy solid state
relays) with flying lead connections for input and output, and M6
bolts for incoming power and ground.

The inputs have voltage dividers so they can be run from nominally 12V
automotive circuits.

Original application: switching my Land Rover headlamps and foglamps
and the horn from near the devices, with big power cables coming in
for low resistance.  I'll probably use the same circuit for spotlamps
etc too.
